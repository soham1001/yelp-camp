YelpCamp is a website where users can create and review campgrounds. In order to review or create a campground, you must have an account. This project was part of Colt Steele's web dev course on udemy.

This project was created using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. Passport.js was used to handle authentication.

This is a full-stack web application project for a startup called Yelp Camp. It is a web application designed to add, rate and review different campgrounds, different users(read campers) can put in their comments and concerns, so that it is a well informed and well prepared camping trip for other users.
